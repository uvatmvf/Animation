# Animation

Sample app demonstrating mvvm wpf with multi binding trigger and animation.

The application uses datatemplates to dynamically change views for the user. The change simulates toggling different views of the same viewmodel at run time, in a scenario where the user is alerted to an issue with an aspect of the application and drills into a more detailed view to see what is wrong.
